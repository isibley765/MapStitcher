1. Run `pip install`. You're also gonna need a `.env` file
2. Download a chromedriver for your OS type [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
    - Make sure it matches your Chrome's version in the Chrome menu > Help > About Google Chrome
    - Remember the `path` of where you put the executable
    - Yes, I'm keeping this hinging on Chrome, hate me later
